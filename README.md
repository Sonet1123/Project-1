## Module 1: Black-Scholes Pricing and Greeks 

This module builds an analytical engine for European option pricing under the Black-Scholes framework.

### Key Features
- **Modular implementation** of call and put pricing
- **Analytical Greeks**: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho
- All functions stored in `functions_Black_Scholes.py`

### Visual Explorations
- Option price vs spot price and time to expiration
- Greek sensitivities vs time and spot for both calls and puts
- Moneyness and maturity effects visualized clearly

### Results Interpretation
- Greeks peak around ATM, especially for short maturities
- Delta transitions are sharper for short expiry
- Vega and Theta show meaningful time-decay patterns

This module forms the foundation for future modules involving stochastic volatility, numerical schemes, and delta hedging strategies.

### Numerical Greeks via Finite Differences
This introduces a general-purpose finite difference engine to compute numerical estimates of Greeks and validate them against the analytical solutions. Both call and put options are tested, with results showing strong agreement and low absolute error, confirming the accuracy of the model implementation.

## Module 2: Monte Carlo Pricing for European Options

- Implemented Monte Carlo simulation to price European call and put options.
- Compared standard Monte Carlo with two variance reduction techniques:
  - Antithetic variates
  - Control variates (using Black-Scholes formula as control)
- Computed option prices, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals.
- Benchmarked results against analytical Black-Scholes prices.
- Demonstrated how control variates significantly improve efficiency and accuracy.

### Monte Carlo Greeks Validation

We compared Monte Carlo estimates of Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Rho, Theta) with both analytical Black-Scholes values and finite-difference approximations.

- The three methods produced consistent results, validating the Monte Carlo approach.
- Minor differences, especially in Vega and Gamma, are due to simulation variance but remain within acceptable ranges.


## Module 3: Local Volatility Modeling 
This module extends European option pricing to incorporate non-constant volatility by constructing a synthetic implied volatility surface and computing the corresponding local volatility surface using Dupireâ€™s formula. Simulated asset paths under this local volatility model are used to price European call and put options via Monte Carlo simulation, and compared with standard Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes results.

## Module 4: Stochastic Volatility Models (Heston & GARCH)

In this module, we implement and analyze two stochastic volatility models for pricing European options:

- **Heston Model**: Captures continuous-time stochastic volatility with mean-reversion.
- **GARCH(1,1) Model**: Models discrete-time volatility clustering observed in financial time series.

We simulate asset paths under both models and price call and put options using Monte Carlo. The resulting prices are compared with Black-Scholes benchmark prices, and implied volatilities are computed from Heston and GARCH prices for interpretation under the Black-Scholes framework.

Key insight: GARCH tends to produce higher option prices due to persistent high volatility, whereas Heston produces prices close to Black-Scholes but with more realistic volatility behavior.

### Implied Volatility Analysis

We also computed the implied volatilities from the Heston and GARCH prices by inverting the Black-Scholes formula:

- The Heston model demonstrates volatility skew between call and put options.
- GARCH produces consistently high implied volatility, indicative of its ability to capture fat tails and clustering in volatility.
